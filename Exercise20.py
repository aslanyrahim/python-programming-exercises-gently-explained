# A leap year occurs on all years divisible by four (e.g., 2016, 2020, 2024, and so on).
# However, the exception to this rule is that years divisible by one hundred (e.g., 2100, 2200, 2300, and so on)
# arenâ€™t leap years. And the exception to this exception is that years divisible by four hundred (e.g., 2000, 2400, and so on) are leap years
